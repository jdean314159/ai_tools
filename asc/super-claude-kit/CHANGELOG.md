# Changelog

All notable changes to Super Claude Kit will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

---

## [1.2.1] - 2025-12-12

### Added

- Project slash commands live directly under `.claude/commands/` (`/kickoff`, `/resume`, `/closeout`, `/triage-tests`, `/run-current-tasks`, `/send-sprint-guidance`, `/ready-for-testing`, `/review-architect`, `/review-project-reviewer`, `/ready-for-docs`, `/plan-next-sprint`, `/close-sprint`) so every install starts with shared workflow prompts. The installer now copies them into `.claude/commands/` for the target repo.

### Changed

- `install` now defaults the Pre/Post tool hooks to `Task`/`TodoWrite|Task|Edit|Write` matchers to avoid duplicate prompt echoes in the CLI. Set `SUPER_CLAUDE_ENABLE_READ_GUARDS=1` (or override via `SUPER_CLAUDE_PRE_TOOL_MATCHER` / `SUPER_CLAUDE_POST_TOOL_MATCHER`) before running the installer when you still need the `Read` file-guard behavior.

---

## [1.2.0] - 2025-12-05

### Added

- Worker profile templates in `workers/` plus runtime loading via `CLAUDE_WORKER_PROFILE`.
- Shared hive memory logs under `.claude/shared/` with `shared-log-append.sh` locking and `prune-shared-logs.sh` 48-hour retention.
- Capsule sections for `<files-in-context profile="">`, `<team-tasks>`, and `<team-discoveries>` so every CLI window sees the same context.
- Worker identity parsing (`cache-worker-profile.sh`) that surfaces preferred name/mailbox/temp prefix, exports helper env vars, and displays a reminder every session.
- Background Agent Mail polling (`fetch_inbox MCP tool` + `agent-mail-poller-loop.sh`) with alert/acknowledge workflow for workers flagged `register_with_agent_mail: true`.
- `uses_beads` worker flag that auto-runs `bd quickstart` + `bd ready --json`, logs output to `.claude/beads/quickstart.log`, and exposes it in the session banner.
- Automatic Beads backlog filing: when `uses_beads` workers log a `bug` discovery, `log-discovery.sh` runs `bd create` (type `bug`, priority 1, labels `bug,auto`) and records the result in `.claude/beads/bug-issues.log`.
- Automatic worker temp-file cleanup via `cleanup-worker-temp.sh`, preventing collisions between Agent Mail payloads.

### Changed

- Session hooks now read the worker profile, cache the system message, and inject it via both SessionStart and UserPrompt hooks.
- `log-file-access.sh`, `log-task.sh`, and `log-discovery.sh` append JSON lines to the shared logs; `post-tool-use.sh` reuses `log-task.sh` for TodoWrite syncing.
- Documentation and installer updated to describe worker profiles plus hive memory; manifest now lists the new hooks.

## [2.0.2] - 2025-11-15

### Fixed

- Broken dependency analysis tools due to JSON/TOON format mismatch
- All dependency tools now work correctly (query-deps, impact-analysis, find-circular, find-dead-code)
- Added relative path support to dependency query tools

### Changed

- TOON format is now the default output (71-74% token reduction vs JSON)
- Simplified lib/toon-parser.sh - removed Python dependency, uses grep/awk only
- All .json references updated to .toon across hooks, scripts, and documentation
- Backwards compatible: .json extension still works for JSON format

### Technical Details

- Restored original grep/awk-based TOON parser (simpler, faster, no Python)
- Added `_resolve_path()` and `_find_file_in_graph()` for relative path support
- Updated 10 files to use .toon extension by default
- Net code reduction: -79 lines (168 deletions, 89 insertions)

### Testing

- Verified in super-claude-kit: 15 files, 0.05s scan time
- Verified in Mid-size Repository: 1,228 files, 2.97s scan time
- All 4 dependency tools tested with both absolute and relative paths

## [2.0.1] - 2025-11-15

### Fixed

- Hook JSON schema validation: Added missing `hookEventName: "SessionStart"` field
- Dependency scanner installation: Changed binary downloads from GitHub releases to GitHub raw URLs
- Install script stability: Binary downloads now work immediately without requiring release artifacts

### Changed

- Install script now auto-detects latest stable version from GitHub releases/tags
- Defaults to tagged releases instead of master branch for production stability
- Users can override version: `VERSION=master curl ... | bash` for development
- Improved error messages during dependency scanner installation

### Notes

- Fully backward compatible with v2.0.0
- No user action required for existing installations
- New installs automatically get latest stable version

---

## [2.0.0] - 2025-11-13

### Added

- Dependency Graph Scanner with multi-language support (TypeScript/JavaScript, Go, Python)
- Dependency Scanner Binary at `~/.claude/bin/dependency-scanner`
  - Pre-compiled binaries for macOS (Intel/ARM), Linux, Windows
  - AST-based parsing for accurate dependency extraction
  - Performance: 1000 files in <5s, 10000 files in <30s
- New dependency analysis tools in `.claude/tools/`:
  - `query-deps.sh` - Show file dependencies and reverse dependencies
  - `impact-analysis.sh` - Analyze change impact (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW risk scoring)
  - `find-circular.sh` - Detect circular dependency cycles using Tarjan's algorithm
  - `find-dead-code.sh` - Find potentially unused files
- Automatic dependency graph building on session start
- Comprehensive dependency graph documentation in `CLAUDE_TEMPLATE.md`
- Automatic platform detection in install script (OS/architecture)

### Changed

- Version bumped from 1.1.0 → 2.0.0
- Updated `manifest.json` to include new `tools` component type
- Enhanced install script to install dependency tools and binaries
- SessionStart hook now builds dependency graph automatically
- Output format: dependency graph saved to `.claude/dep-graph.toon`

### Upgrade

```bash
bash .claude/scripts/update-super-claude.sh
```

Fully backward compatible - no breaking changes.
